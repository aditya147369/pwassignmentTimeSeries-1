    "Ans A time series is a sequence of data points collected at successive points in time, typically at regular intervals. This data can represent various phenomena like stock prices, weather patterns, sales figures, or any metric that changes over time. Time series analysis involves studying these data points to understand underlying patterns, trends, and seasonality. Some common applications include forecasting future values (like predicting stock prices or sales), understanding the factors influencing the series (like the impact of weather on crop yields), and anomaly detection (identifying unusual events or outliers in the data).   "

It can capture both the overall trend and the seasonal variations, leading to more accurate forecasts compared to a simple ARIMA model."
